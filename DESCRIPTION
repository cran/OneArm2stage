Description: Two-stage design for single-arm phase II 
		trials with time-to-event endpoints (e.g., clinical trials on 
		immunotherapies among cancer patients) can be calculated using this package. 
		Two notable advantages of the package: 1) It provides flexible choices from 
		three design methods (optimal, minmax, and admissible), and 2) the power of
		the design is more accurately calculated using the exact variance in the
		one-sample log-rank test. The package can be used for 1) planning the sample
		sizes and other design parameters, and 2) conducting the interim and final
		analyses for the Go/No-go decisions. More details about the design method
		can be found in: Wu, J, Chen L, Wei J, Weiss H, Chauhan A. (2020).
