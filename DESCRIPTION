Description: The proposed two-stage design can be used for single-arm phase II trial designs with 
    time-to-event endpoints, which is desirable for clinical trials on immunotherapies 
    among cancer patients. There're two advantages of the proposed approach: 1) It provides
    flexible choices of four underlying survival distributions and 2) the power of the design
    is more accurately calculated using exact variance in one-sample log-rank test. The package
    can be used for 1) planning the sample size; 2) conducting the interim and final analyses for
    the Go/No-go decisions. More details about the design method can be found in the paper:
